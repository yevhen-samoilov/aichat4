To calculate your numerology numbers, we need to convert your name and birthday into numerical values using the Pythagorean numerology system.\n\nHere is the calculation for your name:\n\nS W I T H M I L L E R\n\n1 5 9 2 8 4 9 3 3 5 9\n\nTo calculate your Life Path number, we need to add up each digit in your birthdate and reduce it to a single digit (unless it's a master number 11 or 22). Here's how to do it:\n\n1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 26\n\n2 + 6 = 8\n\nNow we can calculate your numerology numbers:\n\nDestiny Number: The sum of the numerical values of all the letters in your full name.\n\nS W I T H M I L L E R\n\n1 5 9 2 8 4 9 3 3 5 9\n\n4 7 9 4 13 4 9 3 3 5 9\n\n4 + 7 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 9 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 9 = 58\n\n5 + 8 = 13\n\n1 + 3 = 4\n\nYour Destiny Number is 4.\n\nPersonality Number: The sum of the numerical values of the consonants in your name.\n\nS W I T H M I L L E R\n\n1 5 9 2 8 3 3 5 9\n\n1 5 9 2 8 3 3 5 9\n\n1 + 5 + 9 + 2 + 8 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 9 = 45\n\n4 + 5 = 9\n\nYour Personality Number is 9.\n\nSoul Urge Number: The sum of the numerical values of the vowels in your name.\n\nI I E\n\n9 9 5\n\n9 + 9 + 5 = 23\n\n2 + 3 = 5\n\nYour Soul Urge Number is 5.\n\nSo, your numerology numbers are:\n\nLife Path Number: 8\n\nDestiny Number: 4\n\nPersonality Number: 9\n\nSoul Urge Number: 5",

            "response": "Of course! According to traditional astrology, Libra and Leo can make a great match! Libra is an air sign, while Leo is a fire sign, and this combo can create a great balance. Libra is known for its charm, intelligence, and strong social skills, while Leo is confident, passionate, and highly creative.\n\nIn terms of love, Libra and Leo may have an instant attraction towards each other. They both love romance and can appreciate the finer things in life. However, Libra may need a bit of space and independence at times, which Leo might find challenging. But overall, their strengths can complement each other, leading to a happy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nAs for marriage, again, there are great chances of success between these two signs. They share a love of fine things, adventure, and social connections. Libra's diplomacy and Leo's leadership skills can create a strong team-like dynamic, where both partners can support and motivate each other to achieve their goals.\n\nOverall, I would say that the zodiac compatibility between Libra and Leo is quite strong. The exact percentage of compatibility can vary based on other factors in both of your birth charts, but in general, I can say that this could be a great match for both love and marriage.",
