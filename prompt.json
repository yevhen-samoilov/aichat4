The leaves were not very filling and the moose was getting tired. He was about to give up when he saw a rabbit run by. The moose was hopeful and followed the rabbit. The rabbit ran into a hole in the ground and the moose was lost. The moose was about to give up when he saw a large apple tree. He climbed the tree and ate the apples that were on the tree. He was very happy and felt much better.",
