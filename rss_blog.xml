Artificial Intelligence has been one of the most fascinating technologies in recent years. From self-driving cars to personalized recommendations on e-commerce platforms, AI has been making our lives easier in many ways. One of the most significant applications of AI is in chatbots, which are revolutionizing the way businesses interact with their customers. Chatbots have been around for a while, but with AI, they have become smarter and more efficient. In this article, we will explore the role of chatbots in marketing automation and how they are shaping the future of customer engagement.

What are chatbots?

Chatbots can be deployed on various platforms like websites, messaging apps, and voice assistants. They can handle a wide range of tasks like customer support, lead generation, and sales, among others.
