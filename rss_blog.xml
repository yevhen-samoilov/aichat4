3. Cost-Effective

AI-powered chatbots are cost-effective compared to human agents. They can handle multiple queries at the same time, without getting tired or bored. This means that companies can save money on hiring and training human agents, while still providing excellent customer service.

4. Personalized Service

AI-powered chatbots can provide personalized service by using customer data to provide tailored responses. They can access customer profiles and purchase history to provide relevant information and recommendations. This ensures that customers feel valued and appreciated.
